            <h2>About Us</h2> <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                As first time parents we wanted to encourage our little boy, Yunus, to explore the outdoors without the seatbelts and straps. 
                We found that the only way to let him freely enjoy the texture of rustling leaves, colours of blossoming plants and sounds of birds and wildlife was to take him for baby friendly walks and let him have free reign. <br>
            <br> 
                This also encouraged us to stay fit and healthy. After all, we all want to keep active so that we can play sport and run around with our kids as they get older - who doesn't! <br>
            <br>
                Having no experience or knowledge of hiking, we have started this group to invite families from all backgrounds to come join us on walking trails where we can spend time with our little ones, get to know other mums and dads (or grandparents, aunts and uncles!) and just have a good ol' chat.  <br>
            <br>
                We hope you find this useful and most importantly hope that your little ones flourish and absorb what nature has to offer! <br>
            <br>
                Little steps. Big journeys...<br>
